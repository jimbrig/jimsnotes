## Some of my Favorites:

- [R/Useful-Packages.md](https://github.com/jimbrig/jimsnotes/blob/main/R/R-Useful-Packages.md) - listing of various R packages I have found helpful.

- [Windows/SFC-DISM-commands.md](https://github.com/jimbrig/jimsnotes/blob/main/Windows/SFC-DISM-commands.md) - write-up I made on the SFC /scannow and DISM windows command line tools as well as their registry entries for adding to the Desktop context menu.
