# Microsoft Edge - Experimental Features

Access via [edge://flags](edge://flags).

---

## Vertical Tabs

Probably my favorite experimental feature is the `vertical tabs` flag.

* Enable Vertical Tabs [\#edge-vertical-tabs](edge://flags/#edge-vertical-tabs)

## Tab Groups

* Enable Tab Groups via [\#edge-tab-groups](edge://flags/#edge-tab-groups) and take it even further with [\#edge-tab-groups-auto-create](edge://flags/#edge-tab-groups-auto-create) and [\#edge-tab-groups-collapse](edge://flags/#edge-tab-groups-collapse)!

## Force Dark Mode for all Web Contents

No more need for the (awesome) extension *DarkReader*, now you can enforce dark mode within Edge. 

* Enable `Force Dark Mode for Web Contents` flag via [\#enable-force-dark](edge://flags/#enable-force-dark) and restart.

Here's what Github now looks like:

## *NEW* Edge Color Theme Picker

* Enable `Enable picker for color based themes` via [\#edge-color-theme-picker](edge://flags/#edge-color-theme-picker) and restart browser.
* Navigate to `Settings > Appearance` or directly via [edge://settings/appearance](edge://settings/appearance) and from here you can customize the default Edge theme and accent color:

*New as of December 2020*

## Global Media Controls

One of the [best Chrome features](https://beebom.com/chrome-settings-change/) is the new global media controls and I am happy that Microsoft has brought the same feature to Edge as well. This makes **media controls on MS Edge quite accessible** and you can perform operations such as play/pause/change tracks from a single location.

Along with that, it also allows you to **create a PiP window** from the media control tooltip. After enabling this flag, you will find the toolbar on the top-right corner. As for the flags, you need to enable these two options.
